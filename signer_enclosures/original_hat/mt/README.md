## "MoneroTime" enclosures

These designs are best known as CNC milled aluminum enclosures that were designed and produced by an anonymous individual first identifying himself as "MoneroTime".

It should be noted that these enclosures require a custom soldering process where GPIO pins are soldered directly to the Raspberry Pi Zero board.

The enclosure is designed to be used with forty (40) loose 5.8mm GPIO pins, four (4) m2.5 M-F spacers that allow for 4mm of space between the boards,and four (4) m2.5 screws.

Both designs implement a standard Raspberry Pi "Zero Cam", and it should also be noted that the v2 designs implement a custom microSD extension module.

## "MoneroTime" enclosures

These designs are best known as CNC milled aluminum enclosures that were designed and produced by an anonymous individual first identifying himself as "MoneroTime".

It should be noted that these enclosures require a custom soldering process where GPIO pins are soldered directly to the Raspberry Pi Zero board.

This README will be updated in the near future with the sizes for the GPIO pins, M-F risers and scews that are necessary for the build.

Both designs implement a standard Raspberry Pi "Zero Cam", and it should also be noted that the v2 designs implement a custom microSD extension module.
